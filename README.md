MVVM Architecture

The project follows the MVVM architectural pattern, which separates the application into three main components:

Model: Represents the data and business logic. In this case, the Movie and Result classes serve as the models that hold movie data retrieved from the API.

View: Represents the UI components visible to the user. The MovieListFragment and MovieDetailsActivity classes serve as the views that display the list of movies and the movie details, respectively.

ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the view and the model. The view models are responsible for retrieving and manipulating data from the model and providing it to the view for display. Although the view models are not explicitly shown in the provided code, it is common in MVVM to have separate view model classes that handle data operations.

Data Binding

The project also utilizes data binding, a feature provided by the Android Data Binding library. Data binding allows for a more seamless integration between the model and the view by automatically updating the UI when the underlying data changes.


By adopting MVVM and utilizing data binding, the project promotes a separation of concerns, making the code more modular, maintainable, and testable. The use of data binding further simplifies the process of updating the UI when the underlying data changes.
